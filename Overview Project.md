## 1. Introduction
In this project, I did some steps to predict late delivery orders: import, clean, analysis, visualize data. I used Logistics dataset of Shopee Code League.
## 2. Task
Identify all the orders that are considered late depending on the Service Level Agreements (SLA) with our Logistics Provider. Then, build and train Logistics Regression model.
(Columns required: is_late: assign value 1 if the order is late, otherwise 0).
